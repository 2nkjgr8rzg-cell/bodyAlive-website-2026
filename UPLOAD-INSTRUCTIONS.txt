UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS (GitHub + Vercel)

What you have:
- A static site (index.html + assets). No build step. Vercel should treat it as a plain static deployment.

1) GitHub (web / iPhone Safari friendly)
- Open your repository on GitHub
- Make sure you are on the branch Vercel deploys (usually "main")
- Upload these files to the *repo root* (same level as README.md):
  index.html
  (optional) index-single-file.html
  assets/ (folder)
  hero-image.jpg
  favicon.ico
  apple-touch-icon.png
  icon-512.png
  robots.txt
  sitemap.xml
  site.webmanifest

2) Vercel (common reasons you see “no changes”)
- Your Vercel project may be connected to a different repo or a different branch.
- Your files may be in a subfolder, but Vercel is serving the repo root (or vice versa).
- Vercel may be using a Framework preset (like Next.js) instead of “Other”.

Quick fix checklist in Vercel:
- Project → Settings → Git
  - Confirm the correct repo and correct branch
- Project → Settings → Build & Output
  - Framework Preset: set to "Other"
  - Build Command: leave EMPTY
  - Output Directory: leave EMPTY
  - Install Command: leave EMPTY
- Redeploy the latest commit (Deployments tab → Redeploy)

3) Fast visual check
After deployment, hard refresh:
- iPhone Safari: tap the URL bar → reload, or clear cache if it’s stubborn.
