UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS (GitHub + Vercel)

What you have:
- index.html (single page website)
- assets/ (styles, script, images incl. placeholders)
- favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, icon-512.png
- robots.txt, sitemap.xml, site.webmanifest

Option 1: GitHub Pages
1) In your repo, upload ALL files/folders from this package to the root (same level as index.html).
2) In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main (or master) / root
3) Wait for Pages to publish, then open the Pages URL.

Option 2: Vercel
1) Create a new Vercel project and import your GitHub repo.
2) Framework preset: "Other"
3) Build command: leave empty
4) Output directory: leave empty (Vercel will serve index.html)
5) Deploy.

Image swap (recommended):
- Replace these placeholder images with real clinic photos:
  assets/hero-image.jpg
  assets/clinic-room.jpg
  assets/movement.jpg
  assets/rehab-space.jpg

Keep filenames the same and your site updates instantly.

IMAGE CHECKLIST (swap placeholders with real photos, keep filenames)
- assets/hero-image.jpg          (therapist working on client, bright treatment room)
- assets/family-real-people.jpg  (normal people / mixed ages, casual, humane)
- assets/hands-detail.jpg        (close-up hands, precision, not spa-style)
- assets/movement.jpg            (therapist guiding movement / exercise)
- assets/clinic-room.jpg         (empty bright room, clean, minimal)
- assets/older-client.jpg        (older client moving confidently or being treated)

Photo style rules:
- Bright, daylight/clinical light; neutral backgrounds; realistic bodies.
- Avoid spa props (candles/petals), oily soft-focus shots, neon/pink glows, or “energy” graphics.

V3 REDESIGN NOTES
- This version restructures the entire page around: Outcomes → Advanced Therapy vs Spa → Method → Movement → Inputs → Longevity → Value → FAQ → Location.
- Copy is clinical/professional and avoids medical cure claims while still selling the core philosophy.
